    <h1><u>Magufuli's death story <style></style></u></h1>
    <p><i><strong>Magufuli died on 17 March 2021 at 6 p.m. EAT (15:00 UTC),<br>
     according to a statement read out by vice-president Samia Suluhu Hassan,
      who was sworn in as his successor two days later.<br> 
      He was the only President of Tanzania to die in office.<br>
       14 days of national mourning were declared, with flags flying at half-mast nationwide.
 
 Prior to his death, he had not been seen in public since 27 February,
 leading to speculation over his health. <br>
 The government attributed his death to a heart condition accompanied by a decade-long 
 chronic atrial fibrillation, although opposition figures and some media <br>
 sources alleged that Magufuli had contracted COVID-19.<br>
 
 Magufuli's remains were laid in state at the Uhuru Stadium in 
 Dar es Salaam on 20 March.[96] <br>
 His state funeral was held two days later at the Jamhuri Stadium in Dodoma, 
 and he was buried in his hometown of Chato on 26 March.<br></strong></i></p>

      <p><b><i>A former teacher and industrial chemist, Magufuli was known as “the bulldozer” 
        for his no-nonsense approach to building roads during his stints as 
        minister of works (2000-05 and 2010-15).<br><br>

        In 2015, he became an unexpected presidential candidate for the CCM, the party that 
        along with its predecessor had uninterruptedly been in power since independence 
        
        but was rocked at the time by internal divisions and corruption scandals.<br><br>
        
        Faced with the prospect of defeat, the CCM turned to Magufuli whose hard-nosed 
        reputation was seen as an antidote to the ignominy which plagued the party’s upper ranks.<br><br>
        
        Having leap-frogged the political heavyweights, 
        Magufuli went on to win the 2015 election 
        but the happenstance of his “accidental” presidency did nothing 
        to dampen his vision.<br><br>Magufuli was impatient to see results, 
        and his zeal to fight corruption and develop Tanzania’s 
        infrastructure is what many will remember him for.<br><br>
        
        “Death has robbed us of the leader you might have become if our 
        prayers had been answered,” lamented columnist and commentator 
        Elsie Eyakuze, in an intimate open letter to Magufuli last week.</i><br></b></p>
